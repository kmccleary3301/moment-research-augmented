# MOMENT

Official research code for the paper MOMENT: A Family of Open Time-series Foundation Models. For a functional package to use just Moment model, use [momentfm](https://github.com/moment-timeseries-foundation-model/moment).

## ðŸ“– Introduction
We introduce MOMENT, a family of open-source foundation models for general-purpose time-series analysis. Pre-training large models on time-series data is challenging due to (1) the absence a large and cohesive public time-series repository, and (2) diverse time-series characteristics which make multi-dataset training onerous. Additionally, (3) experimental benchmarks to evaluate these models especially in scenarios with limited resources, time, and supervision, are still in its nascent stages. To address these challenges, we compile a large and diverse collection of public time-series, called the Time-series Pile, and systematically tackle time-series-specific challenges to unlock large-scale multi-dataset pre-training. Finally, we build on recent work to design a benchmark to evaluate time-series foundation models on diverse tasks and datasets in limited supervision settings. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our pre-trained models with minimal data and task-specific fine-tuning. Finally, we present several interesting empirical observations about large pre-trained time-series models.

### MOMENT: One Model, Multiple Tasks, Datasets & Domains

MOMENT on different datasets and tasks, without any parameter updates:
- _Imputation:_ Better than statistical imputation baselines
- _Anomaly Detection:_ Second best $F_1$ than all baselines
- _Classification:_ More accurate than 11 / 16 compared methods
- _Short-horizon Forecasting:_ Better than ARIMA on some datasets

By linear probing (fine-tuning the final linear layer): 
- _Imputation:_ Better than baselines on 4 / 6 datasets
- _Anomaly Detection:_ Best $F_1$
- _Long-horizon Forecasting:_ Competitive in some settings

### MOMENT Captures the Language of Time Series
Principal components of the embeddings of synthetically generated sinusoids suggest that MOMENT can capture subtle trend, scale, frequency, and phase information. In each experiment, $c$ controls the factor of interest, for example the power of the trend polynomial $c \in [\frac{1}{8}, 8) (Oreshkin et al., 2020). We generate multiple sine waves by varying $c$, derive their sequence-level representations using MOMENT, and visualize them in a 2-dimensional space using PCA.

### MOMENT Learns Meaningful Representation of Data
PCA visualizations of representations learned by MOMENT on the [ECG5000](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ecg5000) dataset in UCR Classification Archive. Here different colors represent different classes. Even without dataset-specific fine-tuning, MOMENT learns distinct representations for different classes.

### Architecture in a Nutshell

A time series is broken into disjoint fixed-length sub-sequences called patches, and each patch is mapped into a D-dimensional patch embedding. During pre-training, we mask patches uniformly at random by replacing their patch embeddings using a special mask embedding `[MASK]`. The goal of pre-training is to learn patch embeddings which can be used to reconstruct the input time series using a light-weight reconstruction head.

## Usage

Install the package using:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/moment-timeseries-foundation-model/moment-research.git
```

To use the model, you can use the following code:
```python
from models.moment import MOMENTPipeline

# Options: "pre-training", "short-horizon-forecasting", "long-horizon-forecasting", "classification", "imputation", "anomaly-detection", "embed"
task_name = "classification"  

model = MOMENTPipeline.from_pretrained(
    "AutonLab/test-t5-small",
    model_kwargs={
        "task_name": task_name,
        "n_channels": 1,
        "num_class": 2,
    },
)
model.init()
```

## Installation

Required Python version: 3.11.5

To reproduce our development environment, run the following commands:
```bash
> # Create a Conda environment
> conda create -n moment python=3.11.5
> # Activate the environment
> conda activate moment 
> # Install all the dependencies
> pip install git+https://github.com/moment-timeseries-foundation-model/moment-research.git
```

## Experiments Reproduction

First create a `.env` file in the `moment-research/` directory, and add the following environment paths:

```bash
## MOMENT project Environment Variables
MOMENT_DATA_DIR=data/Timeseries-PILE
MOMENT_CHECKPOINTS_DIR=results/moment_checkpoints/
MOMENT_RESULTS_DIR=results/moment_results/

# Weights and Biases Environment Variables
WANDB_DIR=results/wandb/wandb
WANDB_CACHE_DIR=results/.cache/wandb
```

To download the Timeseries-PILE dataset, run the following command:
```bash
bash reproduce/download_pile.sh
```

To pre-train the model on the previously downloaded Timeseries-PILE dataset, run the following command:
```bash
bash reproduce/pretraining/pretrain.sh
```

To reproduce any other experiment, look into the `reproduce/` directory and run the corresponding script. For example, to reproduce the cross-modal experiments, run the following command:
```bash
bash reproduce/cross-modal/FlanT5.sh
```
